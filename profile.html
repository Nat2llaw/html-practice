                Kirby is the main protagonist of the Kirby series of video games owned by Nintendo. He first appeared in Kirby's Dream Land (1992), a platform game, for the Game Boy. Originally a placeholder, created by Japanese video game designer Masahiro Sakurai, for the game's early development, he has since then starred in over 20 games, ranging from action platformers to puzzle, racing, and even pinball, and has been featured as a playable character in every installment of the Super Smash Bros. series. He has also starred in his own anime and manga series.

                Kirby's Abilities

                Kirby's main ability is inhaling enemies and objects and spitting them out with incredible force. Both his mouth and body expand to allow him to inhale things much larger than himself. However, there is a limit to what he can inhale; excessively large or heavy foes like bosses can resist Kirby's inhale. Against these opponents Kirby must find smaller characters to use as ammo or intercept his opponent's attacks and send them back at them. In Kirby and the Forgotten Land, Kirby gains a new ability: his extremely elastic skin allows him to inhale large objects and take on their shape; this ability is referred to as "Mouthful Mode". During this state, Kirby is able to control whatever he inhaled as if he was the object himself; for example, when Kirby inhales a car, he is able to make it drive around, or in the case of a light bulb, make it turn on and off at will.
